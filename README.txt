A repo for a basic web page about myself

This repo contains a few web pages that give a brief overview of who I am. They were created for a Comp 20 assignment.

Now I'm trying to make it a presentable personal website

TODO
====

Background - figure out something to do

Different font - maybe match what I have on my resume

Attach resume as a pdf once I get it down to one page

Add more content

Figure out some better stylings, it's very basic right now
