    <title>Sam Weiss : Biography</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p ID="subtitle">Statistics</p>
    <p ID="shortp">My name is Sam Weiss, I'm 19 years old, I grew up in Edina, Minnesota, a small city about 15 minutes south of Minneapolis. I graduated from Edina High School with academic honors in the spring of 2013 and I am currently enrolled at Tufts University School of Engineering as a computer science major, and I plan on graduating in the spring of 2017.</p>
    <p ID="subtitle">Personal Mission Statement</p>
    <p ID="shortp">I am and always have been very passionate about education and discovery. I make a point to go out of my way to learn new and interesting things, pushing the boundaries of what I know. As a kid my parents enrolled me in a french immersion program which sparked an interest in languages for me. Since that first day of kindergaten I've learned many different languages, both programming and speaking, even going so far as to take almost three years of japanese. Outside of languages my passion for knowledge drove me to participate in science fairs, and robotics teams.</p>
    <p ID="subtitle">Computer Science</p>
    <p ID="shortp">I was first introduced to computer science through my middle school <a href="http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/frc">FIRST Robotics</a> team. From very basic designs in TI-BASIC in middle school to virtual machine image manipulation tools in python, I continue to be passionate about my future in computer science. Every day I am challenged and humbled as I learn more new things at Tufts. My interests in computing also extend outside of academic contexts, I love to do explorative coding, desiging writing code simply to see if something is possible. I also contribute to online projects when possible, for example I'm a major contributor to several <a href="http://boinc.berkeley.edu/">BOINC</a> projects.</p>
