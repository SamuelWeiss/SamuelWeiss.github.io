    <p ID="subtitle">Short Biography</p>
    <p ID="shortp">On a cold November 28, 1994 in Milwaukee Wisconsin, Samuel Weiss was born. A few short months later he moved across the border to Edina Minnesota where he spent the next 18 years. After many years of schooling, Sam had the chance to matriculate at Tufts University in Boston where he is currently studying computer science in the School of Engineering.</p>
    <p ID="subtitle">Personal Mission Statement</p>
    <p ID="shortp">I was fortunate enough to grow up in an environment that placed the utmost importance on education and discovery, and that drive to learn soaked into me. I seek always to expand myself and learn new things, especially in the area of computer science. I seek to learn all that I can about computing, and to overcome any challenges I encounter, regardless of how daunting they might seem.</p>
    <p ID="subtitle">Computer Science</p>
    <p ID="shortp">I've had a deep interest in computer science since I first learned about programming on my middle school <a href="http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/frc">FIRST Robotics</a> team. Since those early days of very basic design I've learned so much, and I'm continuing to learn new things every day at Tufts. My interests in computing also extend outside of academic contexts, I love to do explorative coding, desiging writing code simply to see if something is possible. I also contribute to online projects when possible, for example I'm a major contributor to several <a href="http://boinc.berkeley.edu/">BOINC</a> projects.</p>
